== Turn structure (Motash)

Motash: Greetings, young Magi. I am Motash, the Underlord of Underneath. I am here to teach you about the turn structure of this game.

Player: Hi, Motash. I'm looking forward to learning more about the game.

Motash: The turn structure of this game consists of six phases: Energize, Power/Spells/Relics, Attack, Summon Dream Creatures, Power/Spells/Relics, and Draw.

Player: Okay, that sounds interesting. Can you explain each phase in more detail?

Motash: Of course. In the Energize phase, you will add energy equal to your energize level to your Magi card. This energy can be used to summon dream creatures or use powers, spells, and relics.

Player: I see. And then in the Power/Spells/Relics phase, I can play and use any of those cards in my hand?

Motash: That's correct. In the first Power/Spells/Relics phase, you can play and use any powers, spells, or relics that you want. This can include cards that increase your energize level, protect your Magi from attacks, or enhance the abilities of your dream creatures.

Player: Got it. And then in the Attack phase, I can use my dream creatures to attack my opponent's creatures or Magi?

Motash: Yes, that's right. In the Attack phase, you can use your dream creatures on the battlefield to attack your opponent's creatures or Magi. Each dream creature can only attack once per turn, so plan your attacks carefully.

Player: And then in the Summon Dream Creatures phase, I can pay for dream creatures to come to the battlefield?

Motash: Yes, that's correct. In the Summon Dream Creatures phase, you can pay the energy cost of dream creatures in your hand to summon them to the battlefield. You can only summon one dream creature per turn, so choose wisely.

Player: And then in the second Power/Spells/Relics phase, I can use any powers, spells, or relics that I didn't use in the first phase?

Motash: That's right. In the second Power/Spells/Relics phase, you can play and use any powers, spells, or relics that you didn't use in the first phase. This can include cards that increase your energize level, protect your Magi from attacks, or enhance the abilities of your dream creatures.

Player: And then in the Draw phase, I draw two cards to signal that my turn is over?

Motash: Yes, that's correct. In the Draw phase, you will draw two cards from your deck to add to your hand. This signals the end of your turn, and your opponent will then take their turn according to the same turn structure.

Player: I see. Thank you, Motash, for explaining the turn structure of the game to me.

Motash: You're welcome, young Magi. I hope this knowledge will help you to master the game and become a powerful Magi. May your dreams be filled with wonder and magic.

== Playing creatures (Ora)

Ora: Hello, young Magi! I am Ora, the Defender of the Sky. I am here to teach you the basics of summoning dream creatures from your hand.

Player: Hi, Ora. I'm excited to learn more about the game.

Ora: In order to summon dream creatures, your Magi card must have enough energy. You can see how much energy your Magi has by looking at the energy meter on the card.

Player: Okay, I see it.

Ora: Once you have enough energy, you can play dream creatures from your hand by placing them on the battlefield in front of you. Each dream creature has its own unique abilities and stats, so choose wisely.

Player: Got it. So dream creatures are important for both attacking and defending?

Ora: That's right! Dream creatures are essential for both attacking and defending in this game. You can use them to attack your opponent's Magi or their dream creatures, and they can also defend your Magi from attacks.

Player: I understand. Thanks for the lesson, Ora.

Ora: You're welcome, young Magi. I'm glad I could help you get started. Now go forth and summon your dream creatures wisely!

== Playing relics (Orthea)

Orthea: Greetings, young Magi. I am Orthea, the Voice of the Storm. I am here to teach you about the use of relics in this game.

Player: Hi, Orthea. I'm interested in learning more about relics.

Orthea: Relics are powerful cards that can provide various benefits to your Magi or dream creatures. They usually cost no energy to play, but there are some restrictions on their use.

Player: What are the restrictions on using relics?

Orthea: One important restriction is that you cannot have two relics with the same name in play at the same time. This means that if you already have a relic with a certain name in play, you cannot play another relic with the same name.

Player: I see. That makes sense.

Orthea: Another important restriction is that your Magi can only play relics from their own region or "Universal" relics. This means that if your Magi is from Cald, for example, they can only play relics from Cald or Universal relics.

Player: I understand. And if my Magi is defeated, all the relics I have in play are discarded?

Orthea: That's right. If your Magi is defeated, all the relics you have in play are discarded. This means that you must be careful about when and how you use your relics, as they can be a valuable asset but can also be easily lost.

Player: I see. Thanks for explaining the rules and restrictions of using relics, Orthea.

Orthea: You're welcome, young Magi. I hope this knowledge will help you to use relics wisely and effectively in your battles. May your storms be powerful and your dreams be filled with magic.

== Playing spells and using abilities (Grega)

Grega: Hey there, young Magi! I'm Grega, the fiery Magi of Cald. I'm here to teach you about spells and abilities in this game.

Player: Hi, Grega. I'm interested in learning more about how spells and abilities work.

Grega: Spells are one-time effects that you can play from your hand if your Magi has enough energy. When you play a spell, you must pay its energy cost, and then the spell's effect will immediately be applied.

Player: I see. And what are abilities?

Grega: Abilities are special powers that creatures, relics, and Magi can have. Like spells, abilities also have energy costs, but the way they are paid for and used is different.

Player: How are abilities different from spells?

Grega: The main difference is that creature abilities are paid for by the creature's own energy, while relic and Magi abilities are paid for by the energy from the Magi. This means that you can only use a creature's ability if the creature has enough energy, and you can only use a relic or Magi ability if your Magi has enough energy.

Player: I see. And can abilities be used at any time, or are there restrictions on when they can be used?

Grega: Each ability can only be used once per turn, and they can only be used during the first or second Power/Spells/Relics phase. This means that you must plan carefully when and how you use your abilities, as they can be a valuable asset but are limited in their use.

Player: I understand. Thanks for explaining spells and abilities, Grega.

Grega: No problem, young Magi. I hope this knowledge will help you to use spells and abilities wisely and effectively in your battles. May your flames burn bright and your dreams be filled with magic.


== Attacking (Poad)

Poad: Hey there, young Magi! I'm Poad, the food-loving Magi of Naroom. I'm here to teach you about attacking with creatures in this game.

Player: Hi, Poad. I'm interested in learning more about how to attack with my creatures.

Poad: Attacking with creatures is an important part of this game, as it allows you to damage your opponent's Magi or their creatures. Most creatures can only attack once per turn, but there are some that can attack twice.

Player: I see. And can my creatures attack my opponent's Magi directly, or do they have to attack their creatures first?

Poad: Your creatures cannot attack your opponent's Magi directly while they have any creatures in play. You must attack and defeat their creatures first before you can attack their Magi. This means that you must plan your attacks carefully and consider the strengths and weaknesses of your own and your opponent's creatures.

Player: I understand. And do you have any tips for attacking with my creatures?

Poad: One tip I have is to use my own ability, Feast, to add energy to each of my creatures. This can help them survive attacks and deal more damage to your opponent's creatures or Magi.

Player: That's a great tip, Poad. Thanks for explaining how to attack with creatures.

Poad: You're welcome, young Magi. I hope this knowledge will help you to attack wisely and effectively in your battles. May your stomach always be full and your dreams be filled with magic.
